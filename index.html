Ponga was born in Port Hedland, Western Australia to New Zealand-born parents, and is of MƒÅori descent by way of his father's ancestry.[3] He spent an early portion of his life in Newman, Western Australia before moving to Mount Isa, Queensland at the age of 2.[4] In 2006, at the age of 8, he relocated with his family to Palmerston North, New Zealand and spent five years there, where he played a number of sports; including rugby league, touch football, hockey, rugby union, golf and soccer. In 2010, he won New Zealand's under-13 national golf championship.[5 In 2011, at the age of 13, Ponga and his family returned to Queensland, settling in Mackay. He attended Mackay State High School and was a member of the Rugby League Academy program, as well as playing junior rugby league for Souths Mackay. Also in 2011, he was signed to a scholarship with the Central Queensland NRL bid side. In 2012, he was selected for the Australian Schoolboys under-15 side, becoming just the second 14-year-old to make the side.[5] </p>

In January, Ponga was selected in the QAS under-20s Origin squad.[19] In February, he played in the Cowboys' first-grade side's trial game against the Broncos, scoring a try. In May, Ponga was selected for the Junior Kangaroos and Junior Kiwis but opted not to play.[3][20] He spent the majority of the season playing for the Cowboys' NYC and was named at fullback in the NYC Team of the Year.[21 On 16 September, Ponga made his NRL debut on the wing against the Brisbane Broncos in the finals, replacing the injured Antonio Winterstein. Ponga was short from scoring his first NRL try in the 16th minute of the game making a break on the wing getting taken down by Broncos Lock Corey Parker.[22] Since 1987, he is just the sixth player to make his first-grade debut in a finals match.[23] He was contracted to the Cowboys until the end of 2017.[24] In November, it was reported that Ponga had signed a contract with the Newcastle Knights starting in 2018. On 17 November, when North Queensland returned to pre-season training, head coach Paul Green confirmed the reports and his disappointment saying the contract was in the cooling off period.[25] The deal was officially announced on 28 November as a four-year contract starting in 2018. It was reported that the deal will make him the highest paid teenager in the history of the NRL.[26]
