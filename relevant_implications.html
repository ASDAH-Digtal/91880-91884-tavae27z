    <h1>Relevant implications</h1>

    <h3>Relevant implication #1: [Intellectual property]</h3>
    <strong>Describe relevant implication</strong>
    <p>[intangible property that is the result of creativity, such as patents, copyrights, etc. intangoble property is creativity and just orginal stuff. I used unsplash.com, a website where I can get free pictures and that I could use copyright free. All the images in my website are free. But if I were to use an picture from Google, I would be copyrighted because Google is not a copyright free site. Only if you ask for permission but thats why i used unsplash, because its free and just way easire to use.]</p>

    <strong>Address relevant implication in relation to your website</strong>
    <p>[To address the relevant implication, I used free copyright websites such as unsplash.com https://unsplash.com/ and pexels https://www.pexels.com/. If I used any other websites to get photos, such as Google photos or Instagram I would get sued because its not copyright free sites.]</p>

    <h3>Relevant implication #2: [Aesthetics]</h3>
    <strong>Describe relevant implication</strong>
    <p>[Aesthetic is a set of principles concerned with the nature and appreciation of beauty. Basically its saying your own perspective on what you think is beauty and what you like. For example I like light colours because its lighten up my mood.

    <strong>Address relevant implication in relation to your website</strong>
    <p>[The relevant implaication relate to my website is because, i used a colour pallate to a colour pallate https://coolors.co/ to pick my faviourite colour blend. I picked theses colours because its a nice transition of blue. Blue is also my faviourte colour, It seems like a nice fade of  colour because the colour are just different shades of blue which makes my website pop out due to the fact that all colour are fitted for my website. It just makes me feel happy to with my website looking better then the rest.]</p>

    <h3>Relevant implication #3: [functionally]</h3>
    <strong>Describe relevant implication</strong>
    <p>[the quality of being suited to serve a purpose well; practicality. To simpify the meaning to it, is that if it works well and serves its purpose. Then its functionally working well. ]</p>

    <strong>Address relevant implication in relation to your website</strong>
    <p>[[To address the relevant implication, I fixed my links so each webpage is accessible through the navigation bar, because it was not coded properly. I also ajusted the phone size for my website. I changed how it it layedout if you get on my website with a mobile device. ]</p>
